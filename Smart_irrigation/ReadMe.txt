We have designed and developed an advanced smart irrigation system that integrates cutting-edge hardware and software components to address the critical challenges of efficient water management in agriculture. The system utilizes a NodeMCU, an Intel UP Squared board, and environmental sensors including a rain sensor, soil moisture sensor, and humidity sensor. These components work together to collect real-time environmental data, enabling precise and automated irrigation control.

The system's communication architecture is built using MQTT servers, which facilitate secure and efficient communication between the UP Squared board, NodeMCU, and the user's monitoring system. This allows real-time data exchange, enabling remote monitoring and control of the irrigation process from any device. The integration of MQTT ensures low-latency communication, making it ideal for real-time operations.

On the software side, the NodeMCU is programmed using C, while the Intel UP Squared board runs on Python. This setup allows the Intel UP Squared board to serve as a powerful processing hub, handling multiple sensor inputs, analyzing data, and automating irrigation schedules. The system also includes a database that stores collected data, enabling users to track historical trends, optimize irrigation strategies, and improve decision-making.

By utilizing custom PCB design, we have ensured that the hardware components are optimized for reliability and performance, allowing the system to function efficiently in diverse agricultural environments. Additionally, the systemâ€™s real-time monitoring capability allows users to access data and control irrigation remotely, ensuring optimal water usage while minimizing waste.

In summary, our smart irrigation system combines sophisticated hardware, custom programming, and real-time communication to provide a scalable and efficient solution for modern agriculture. The use of the Intel UP Squared board as the processing unit, along with real-time monitoring through MQTT servers, provides users with precise control and insights, leading to improved crop health, reduced water consumption, and overall better farm management.
